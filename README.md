## Application Overview

UNO Express is a fun and interesting game, traditionally played by a group of 2 to 4 people with a deck of printed cards. We are proposing to develop this interactive game in C programming language which supports a single player competing against a computer opponent. Playing games online  with computers could speed up our responses and develop logic skills. 

And during the COVID-19  pandemic, we can use this game to keep ourselves entertained while maintaining our social circle. Whatâ€™s more, this game will keep you engaged and help reduce stress. This time you neither need to  fret over saying UNO before you drop your penultimate card nor wait until the deck is shuffled.

By  this project, we intend to develop a UNO game engine that can make choices adhering to the rules of the game. 
This game is similar to the well known UNO game but following modifications are made to deliver this game efficiently as a single player game with a computer opponent.

* UNO Express card game has 56 cards, we removed the 'Reverse' action card as it doesn't make much sense in a two-player game.So,
  the total card count is 52.
* Human player always starts the game first.
* When the Wild Draw two action card is played, the next player automatically loses his turn, gets two cards added to his current set 
  set of cards and the current player can choose the color to continue the game (same as a normal UNO game).
* When the Draw one action card is played, the next player by default loses his turn and a card will be added to his set of cards.
